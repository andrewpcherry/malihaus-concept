/* MaliHaus, the property enquiry funnel.

   This is a NATIVE MaliHaus page. It is not the REI demo funnel restyled.
   What was carried across is the LOGIC ONLY: the six situation branches and
   their questions, the combination intelligence, the shared qualifying
   questions, the A/B/C/X tiering and the lead payload. Everything the
   visitor sees is built from the site's own components (.mh-card, .btn,
   .wrap) and the site's own tokens, so it looks like the rest of MaliHaus
   and nothing like the demo it came from.

   The shape: pick your situation (one or more), then tap through
   qualification, then a short contact step. No dropdowns anywhere.

   Deal structures are deliberately never named. A sophisticated investor
   reads the deal type off the answers, and naming it would publish
   commercial terms MaliHaus has not approved. */

    t:"An estate property and a move of your own",
