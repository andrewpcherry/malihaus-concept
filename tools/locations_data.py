"""The sixteen MaliHaus markets.

HARD RULES for everything in this file, because these pages are the ones
most likely to drift into invention:

  * NO local offices, employees, addresses, telephone numbers, Google
    Business Profiles or map listings. MaliHaus serves these markets, it
    is not physically located in them.
  * NO local transaction history, testimonials, closing statistics,
    property values, offer amounts or market statistics. Not even
    softened ones. If a sentence would need a citation, it is not here.
  * NO claims about local law, foreclosure procedure, probate rules,
    tax or code enforcement. Those differ by state and county and are
    not verified, so every page routes those questions to a local
    professional instead of answering them.
  * Copy is CONDITIONAL and owner-focused ("if your property has...")
    rather than assertive about the market ("this market has...").
  * Geographic statements are limited to common knowledge that does not
    move: which state a city is in, that the Kansas City metropolitan
    area spans a state line, that Greensboro and Winston-Salem sit in
    the same region of North Carolina.

KANSAS CITY IS UNRESOLVED. Michael did not say whether he means
Missouri, Kansas or the metro. The route and copy are deliberately
state neutral. Do not add a state until he confirms it.

Imagery (replaced 2026-09-03 on Michael's feedback that the old images
were repetitive and showed palm trees in markets where that is wrong):
every market now has its OWN image, generated for that market's regional
housing style. Sixteen distinct images, no repeats. Palms and South
Florida architecture appear ONLY in Broward and Miami-Dade. Jacksonville,
Tampa and Orlando are visibly different from each other and from South
Florida. Every northern market shows regional housing with deciduous
trees and no tropical planting.

The images are original AI-generated residential exteriors. They are
generic houses at no real address and are never captioned as MaliHaus
properties or as a specific street. Each is served as WebP at 640w and
1440w from img/markets/<slug>-<width>.webp.
